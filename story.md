# ***my story***

I'm an arctic fox! Let me tell you more about my life...

## Adaptaions

### Adapt to surroundings

#### Fur
It's summer now, so my coat of fur is greyish brown. You probably won't be able to recognise me with greyish brown fur.

When winter comes, my coat of fur will turn white again to camouflage in the white snow.

#### Senses

I have a _really_ strong sense of smell. I can smell **and** find frozen lemmings (thats my main prey, and if you didn't know, I'm also called the lemming fox :D) under 46-77cm of snow ***and*** I can detect a subnivean seal lair under 150cm of snow (isn't that cool?).
I also have _really_ sharp hearing. (Oh well, not as good as a dog or kit fox's) I can easily hear lemmings burrowing under 4-5 inches of snow~ (piece of cake for me :P)

### Adapt to temperature
Since I live in the Arctic where the temperature can be ***really cold***, I have to adapt to the low temperatures. To begin with, my body size already reduces heat loss as I have a low surface area to volume ratio :D
To reduce heat loss even more, I like to curl up tightly and tuck my head and legs under my body and behind my furry tail.
